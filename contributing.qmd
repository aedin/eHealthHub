    People with cancer can interact with research, through participation, engagement, and involvement.

    -   **Participation:** A person with cancer may be enroll in a research study (clinical trial).

    -   **Engagement:** Patients can help communicate with other patients and the public. You could work in communication and sharing of research information, for example, at science festivals, public talks, television programmes, or radio.

    -   **Involvement:** People with cancer can be involved at every stage of the research process, from conceptualisation to dissemination to ensure the perspectives of people with cancer are fully considered during the entire research cycle.

-   **Clinical Trials Ireland**

    Cancer trials test new and more effective ways to prevent, diagnose, and treat cancer. Trials can test new drugs or combinations of drugs that are already used in the treatment of other diseases. Trials can also involve new ways of treating or diagnosing cancer. Unlike non-cancer clinical trials, placebo are rarely used in cancer. Find out more about [clinical trials in Ireland](https://www.cancertrials.ie) or [search for a clinical trial](https://www.cancertrials.ie/cti-trials/) in ireland, or in the [EU](https://euclinicaltrials.eu/search-clinical-trials-reports/), or [USA](https://clinicaltrials.gov).\
