## Projects

The eHealth-Hub for cancer is developing software and frameworks to harmonize, unify and connect clinical data to support all-island cancer research.

-   **All-island characterization of Blood Cancer patient data**

    will enable network observational health studies in Haematological Malignancies. In partnership with colleagues in [Blood Cancer Network Ireland](https://www.bloodcancers.ie/), we will build data dictionaries, maps and tools to harmonize and network;

    -   Adult acute myeloid leukemia (AML)
    -   Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL)
    -   Multiple myeloma (MM)

In mapping blood cancer data to a widely used common data model (OMOP), Irish patients can participate in EU-wide networked blood cancer research.

-   **All-island characterization of Solid Tumour patient data**

    -   Prostate Cancer with the [Irish Prostate Cancer Outcomes Research (IPCOR)](https://www.ipcor.ie/)
    -   Upper gastrointestinal (UGI) cancer
    -   Breast Cancer - study of brain metastasis

- **Harmonizing cancer clinical genomics data**

-   will test standards, build methods and software that support harmonization of all-island cancer genomics data.

-   **Cross-border Cancer Registries ** 
Cancer knows no border and neither do cancer registris

-   **COVID-19 and cancer** 
will study the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on cancer across the island of Ireland
