## Global Partners

We are working with [OHDSI](https://www.ohdsi.org/) and EHDEN, and [Northeastern University OHDSI center](https://ohdsi.northeastern.edu/) and John Hopkins OHDSI to develop training programs for trainees in the eHealth-Hub, so we can join OHDSI as they make healthcare data FAIR at an unprecedented scale, creating new research and economic opportunities in eHealth.
