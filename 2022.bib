  abstract = {The pro-tumourigenic role of epithelial TGFβ signalling in colorectal cancer (CRC) is controversial. Here, we identify a cohort of born to be bad early-stage (T1) colorectal tumours, with aggressive features and a propensity to disseminate early, that are characterised by high epithelial cell-intrinsic TGFβ signalling. In the presence of concurrent Apc and Kras mutations, activation of epithelial TGFβ signalling rampantly accelerates tumourigenesis and share transcriptional signatures with those of the born to be bad T1 human tumours and predicts recurrence in stage II CRC. Mechanistically, epithelial TGFβ signalling induces a growth-promoting EGFR-signalling module that synergises with mutant APC and KRAS to drive MAPK signalling that re-sensitise tumour cells to MEK and/or EGFR inhibitors. Together, we identify epithelial TGFβ signalling both as a determinant of early dissemination and a potential therapeutic vulnerability of CRC's with born to be bad traits.},

  abstract = {In order to tailor treatment to their needs, cancer patients are encouraged to be more active and engaged in their care decisions and to be autonomous yet collaborative with their healthcare professionals when it comes to aspects of their treatment in order to get better results. However, this can only happen after providing them with accurate information about cancer and the different treatment alternatives and their potential side effects. However, sharing robust data-based information is often hindered by exposure to misleading information through different media and online platform, where patients might come across unscientifically founded health practices. Increasing health literacy and cancer-specific literacy is essential to fight this negative trend. The idea is that more knowledgeable patients will be able to debunk more easily misinformation they encounter. This is also related to inequalities among cancer patients. Not only levels of cancer literacy within Europe are uneven across and within countries, but there are social groups that, due to specific social determinants, are systematically less informed and skilled regarding cancer care. In this paper an overview of gaps in addressing literacy issues, and the importance of health literacy to empower patients in their journey through treatment is delineated, concluding with some recommendations to improve cancer literacy in Europe.},

  abstract = {Cancer research is a crucial pillar for countries to deliver more affordable, higher quality, and more equitable cancer care. Patients treated in research-active hospitals have better outcomes than patients who are not treated in these settings. However, cancer in Europe is at a crossroads. Cancer was already a leading cause of premature death before the COVID-19 pandemic, and the disastrous effects of the pandemic on early diagnosis and treatment will probably set back cancer outcomes in Europe by almost a decade. Recognising the pivotal importance of research not just to mitigate the pandemic today, but to build better European cancer services and systems for patients tomorrow, the Lancet Oncology European Groundshot Commission on cancer research brings together a wide range of experts, together with detailed new data on cancer research activity across Europe during the past 12 years. We have deployed this knowledge to help inform Europe's Beating Cancer Plan and the EU Cancer Mission, and to set out an evidence-driven, patient-centred cancer research roadmap for Europe. The high-resolution cancer research data we have generated show current activities, captured through different metrics, including by region, disease burden, research domain, and effect on outcomes. We have also included granular data on research collaboration, gender of researchers, and research funding. The inclusion of granular data has facilitated the identification of areas that are perhaps overemphasised in current cancer research in Europe, while also highlighting domains that are underserved. Our detailed data emphasise the need for more information-driven and data-driven cancer research strategies and planning going forward. A particular focus must be on central and eastern Europe, because our findings emphasise the widening gap in cancer research activity, and capacity and outcomes, compared with the rest of Europe. Citizens and patients, no matter where they are, must benefit from advances in cancer research. This Commission also highlights that the narrow focus on discovery science and biopharmaceutical research in Europe needs to be widened to include such areas as prevention and early diagnosis; treatment modalities such as radiotherapy and surgery; and a larger concentration on developing a research and innovation strategy for the 20 million Europeans living beyond a cancer diagnosis. Our data highlight the important role of comprehensive cancer centres in driving the European cancer research agenda. Crucial to a functioning cancer research strategy and its translation into patient benefit is the need for a greater emphasis on health policy and systems research, including implementation science, so that the innovative technological outputs from cancer research have a clear pathway to delivery. This European cancer research Commission has identified 12 key recommendations within a call to action to reimagine cancer research and its implementation in Europe. We hope this call to action will help to achieve our ambitious 70:35 target: 70% average 10-year survival for all European cancer patients by 2035.},

We reviewed cancer policies in 20 International Cancer Benchmarking Partnership jurisdictions in seven countries and did exploratory analyses linking an index of cancer policy consistency over time, with monitoring and implementation mechanisms, to survival from seven cancers in a subset of ten jurisdictions from 1995 to 2014. All ten jurisdictions had structures in place to oversee or deliver cancer control policies and had published at least one major cancer plan. Few cancer plans had explicit budgets for implementation or mandated external evaluation. Cancer policy consistency was positively correlated with improvements in survival over time for six of the seven cancer sites. Jurisdictions that scored the highest on policy consistency had large improvements in survival for most sites. Our analysis provides an important first step to systematically capture and evaluate what are inherently complex policy processes. The findings can help guide policy makers seeking approaches and frameworks to improve cancer services and, ultimately, cancer outcomes.},

Improvements in healthcare delivery have lengthened life expectancy, but within a situation of increased cancer incidence. The disease burden of CRC has risen significantly, particularly in Africa, Asia and Latin America. Research is key to its control and reduction, but few studies have delineated the volume and funding of global research on CRC. We identified research papers in the Web of Science (WoS) from 2007 to 2021, and determined the contributions of the leading countries, the research domains studied, and their sources of funding. We identified 62 716 papers, representing 5.7% of all cancer papers. This percentage was somewhat disproportionate to the disease burden (7.7% in 2015), especially in Eastern Europe. International collaboration increased over the time period in almost all countries except in China. Genetics, surgery and prognosis were the leading research domains. However, research on palliative care and quality-of-life in CRC was lacking. In Western Europe, the main funding source was the charity sector, particularly in the UK, but in most other countries government played the leading role, especially in China and the USA. There was little support from industry. Several Asian countries provided minimal contestable funding, which may have reduced the impact of their CRC research. Certain countries must perform more CRC research overall, especially in domains such as screening, palliative care and quality-of-life. The private-non-profit sector should be an alternative source of support.},

  abstract = {PURPOSE: Precise mechanism-based gene expression signatures (GES) have been developed in appropriate in vitro and in vivo model systems, to identify important cancer-related signaling processes. However, some GESs originally developed to represent specific disease processes, primarily with an epithelial cell focus, are being applied to heterogeneous tumor samples where the expression of the genes in the signature may no longer be epithelial-specific. Therefore, unknowingly, even small changes in tumor stroma percentage can directly influence GESs, undermining the intended mechanistic signaling.
EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Using colorectal cancer as an exemplar, we deployed numerous orthogonal profiling methodologies, including laser capture microdissection, flow cytometry, bulk and multiregional biopsy clinical samples, single-cell RNA sequencing and finally spatial transcriptomics, to perform a comprehensive assessment of the potential for the most widely used GESs to be influenced, or confounded, by stromal content in tumor tissue. To complement this work, we generated a freely-available resource, ConfoundR; https://confoundr.qub.ac.uk/, that enables users to test the extent of stromal influence on an unlimited number of the genes/signatures simultaneously across colorectal, breast, pancreatic, ovarian and prostate cancer datasets.
RESULTS: Findings presented here demonstrate the clear potential for misinterpretation of the meaning of GESs, due to widespread stromal influences, which in-turn can undermine faithful alignment between clinical samples and preclinical data/models, particularly cell lines and organoids, or tumor models not fully recapitulating the stromal and immune microenvironment.
CONCLUSIONS: Efforts to faithfully align preclinical models of disease using phenotypically-designed GESs must ensure that the signatures themselves remain representative of the same biology when applied to clinical samples.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: In 2014, the COIN-B clinical trial demonstrated that intermittent cetuximab (IC) was a safe alternative to continuous cetuximab (CC), with less cytotoxic chemotherapy, in first-line treatment for KRAS wild-type metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC). Cetuximab has been available for this indication in England since 2015, but treatment breaks beyond 6 weeks were prohibited, despite real-world evidence that therapy de-escalation maintains equivalent disease control, but with superior Quality-of-Life (QoL). We performed health economic analyses of IC versus CC and used this evidence to help underpin policy change and guide clinical practice through reduction in unnecessary treatment for mCRC patients.
METHODS: Employing cost-minimization analysis, we conducted partitioned survival modelling (PSM) and Markov Chain Monte-Carlo (MCMC) simulation to determine costs and quality-adjusted-life-years for IC versus CC.
RESULTS: IC reduced costs by £ 35,763 (PSM; p < 0.001) or £ 30,189 (MCMC) per patient annually, while preserving treatment efficacy and enhancing QoL. Extrapolating to all mCRC patients eligible for cetuximab therapy would have generated cost savings of ~£ 1.2 billion over this cohort's lifetime. These data helped underpin a request to NHS England to remove treatment break restrictions in first-line mCRC therapy, which has been adopted as an interim treatment option policy in colorectal cancer during the Covid-19 pandemic.
CONCLUSIONS: Our results highlight substantial cost savings achievable by treatment de-escalation, while also reinforcing the importance of therapy breaks to potentially increase tumour responsiveness and reduce treatment toxicity. Our study also highlights how health economic evidence can influence health policy, championing reduced treatment intensity approaches without compromising patient outcomes, which is of particular relevance when addressing the reduced capacity and treatment backlogs experienced during the pandemic.},

Four cycles of Modified-MATRIX protocol resulted in a halt in fulminant course of the disease and the patient experienced slight reversal of the neurological deficits, although not deemed clinically fit for a repeat 18FDG-PET/CT due to his poor general well-being. Repeat MRI was suggestive of partial recovery, however. The clinical stability was proven short-lived, and the patient experienced progressive lower limb weakness only 3 weeks after discharge following his last cycle of treatment. Isolated CNS relapse of lymphoma is a rare occurrence in the literature. The CNS recurrence is more often leptomeningeal or confined to the brain parenchyma rather than the spinal cord. The role of 18FDG-PET/CT in the diagnostic algorithm of secondary CNS lymphoma is unclear and its significance in risk stratification and assessing the response to treatment has not been evaluated. This case report illustrates the imaging findings of a more unusual form of the disease with multifocal intramedullary involvement of the spinal cord, and highlights imaging features of this rare condition with 18FDG-PET/CT and MRI to support decision making in good clinical practice.},

METHODS: Cancer e-record and hospital admission data linkage identified adult cases, stage and healthcare pathway to diagnosis (population ~2.5 million). Using multivariate Poisson regressions, we compared 2019 and 2020 counts and estimated incidence rate ratios (IRR).
RESULTS: Cases decreased 15.2% (n = -1011) overall. Female breast annual IRR was 0.81 (95% CI: 0.76-0.86, p < 0.001), colorectal 0.80 (95% CI: 0.79-0.81, p < 0.001) and non-small cell lung 0.91 (95% CI: 0.90-0.92, p < 0.001). Decreases were largest in 50-69 year olds for female breast and 80+ year olds for all cancers. Stage I female breast cancer declined 41.6%, but unknown stage increased 55.8%. Colorectal stages I-IV declined (range 26.6-29.9%), while unknown stage increased 803.6%. Colorectal Q2-2020 GP-urgent suspected cancer diagnoses decreased 50.0%, and 53.9% for non-small cell lung cancer.

Non-smal -cell lung cancer emergency presentation diagnoses increased 9.5% (Q2-2020) and 16.3% (Q3-2020).
CONCLUSION: Significantly fewer cases of three common cancers were diagnosed in 2020. Detrimental impacts on outcomes varied between cancers. Ongoing surveillance with health service optimisation will be needed to mitigate impacts.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Stroma-rich tumours represent a poor prognostic subtype in stage II/III colon cancer (CC), with high relapse rates and limited response to standard adjuvant chemotherapy.
DESIGN: To address the lack of efficacious therapeutic options for patients with stroma-rich CC, we stratified our human tumour cohorts according to stromal content, enabling identification of the biology underpinning relapse and potential therapeutic vulnerabilities specifically within stroma-rich tumours that could be exploited clinically. Following human tumour-based discovery and independent clinical validation, we use a series of in vitro and stroma-rich in vivo models to test and validate the therapeutic potential of elevating the biology associated with reduced relapse in human tumours.
RESULTS: By performing our analyses specifically within the stroma-rich/high-fibroblast (HiFi) subtype of CC, we identify and validate the clinical value of a HiFi-specific prognostic signature (HPS), which stratifies tumours based on STAT1-related signalling (High-HPS v Low-HPS=HR 0.093, CI 0.019 to 0.466). Using in silico, in vitro and in vivo models, we demonstrate that the HPS is associated with antigen processing and presentation within discrete immune lineages in stroma-rich CC, downstream of double-stranded RNA and viral response signalling. Treatment with the TLR3 agonist poly(I:C) elevated the HPS signalling and antigen processing phenotype across in vitro and in vivo models. In an in vivo model of stroma-rich CC, poly(I:C) treatment significantly increased systemic cytotoxic T cell activity (p<0.05) and reduced liver metastases (p<0.0002).
CONCLUSION: This study reveals new biological insight that offers a novel therapeutic option to reduce relapse rates in patients with the worst prognosis CC.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Transcriptionally informed predictions are increasingly important for sub-typing cancer patients, understanding underlying biology and to inform novel treatment strategies. For instance, colorectal cancers (CRCs) can be classified into four CRC consensus molecular subgroups (CMS) or five intrinsic (CRIS) sub-types that have prognostic and predictive value. Breast cancer (BRCA) has five PAM50 molecular subgroups with similar value, and the OncotypeDX test provides transcriptomic based clinically actionable treatment-risk stratification. However, assigning samples to these subtypes and other transcriptionally inferred predictions is time consuming and requires significant bioinformatics experience. There is no "universal" method of using data from diverse assay/sequencing platforms to provide subgroup classification using the established classifier sets of genes (CMS, CRIS, PAM50, OncotypeDX), nor one which in provides additional useful functional annotations such as cellular composition, single-sample Gene Set Enrichment Analysis, or prediction of transcription factor activity.
RESULTS: To address this bottleneck, we developed classifieR, an easy-to-use R-Shiny based web application that supports flexible rapid single sample annotation of transcriptional profiles derived from cancer patient samples form diverse platforms. We demonstrate the utility of the " classifieR" framework to applications focused on the analysis of transcriptional profiles from colorectal (classifieRc) and breast (classifieRb). Samples are annotated with disease relevant transcriptional subgroups (CMS/CRIS sub-types in classifieRc and PAM50/inferred OncotypeDX in classifieRb), estimation of cellular composition using MCP-counter and xCell, single-sample Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (ssGSEA) and transcription factor activity predictions with Discriminant Regulon Expression Analysis (DoRothEA).
CONCLUSIONS: classifieR provides a framework which enables labs without access to a dedicated bioinformation can get information on the molecular makeup of their samples, providing an insight into patient prognosis, druggability and also as a tool for analysis and discovery.

  abstract = {Improving CAR-T cell therapy for solid tumors requires a better understanding of CAR design and cellular composition. Here, we compared second-generation (BBζ and 28ζ) with third-generation (28BBζ) carbonic anhydrase IX (CAIX)-targeted CAR constructs and investigated the antitumor effect of CAR-T cells with different CD4/CD8 proportions in vitro and in vivo. The results demonstrated that BBζ exhibited superior efficacy compared with 28ζ and 28BBζ CAR-T cells in a clear-cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) skrc-59 cell bearing NSG-SGM3 mouse model. The mice treated with a single dose of BBζ CD4/CD8 mixture (CAR4/8) showed complete tumor remission and remained tumor-free 72 days after CAR-T cells infusion. In the other CAR-T and control groups, tumor-infiltrating T cells were recovered and profiled. We found that BBζ CAR8 cells upregulated expression of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II and cytotoxicity-associated genes, while downregulating inhibitory immune checkpoint receptor genes and diminishing differentiation of regulatory T cells (Treg cells), leading to excellent therapeutic efficacy in vivo. Increased memory phenotype, elevated tumor infiltration, and decreased exhaustion genes were observed in the CD4/8 untransduced T (UNT) cells compared with CD8 alone, indicating that CD4/8 would be the favored cellular composition for CAR-T cell therapy with long-term persistence. In summary, these findings support that BBζ CAR4/8 cells are a highly potent, clinically translatable cell therapy for ccRCC.},
