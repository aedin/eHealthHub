    "text": "Motivation\nCancer is the leading cause of death on the island of Ireland. Half of all citizens will experience cancer at some stage in their lifetime. Annually, more than 40,000 and 10,000 people are diagnosed with cancer in Ireland (IRE) and Northern Ireland (NI) respectively. With an aging demographic, the population >65 years is estimated to more than double in the next 25 years National Cancer Strategy 2017-2026 A Cancer Strategy for Northern Ireland 2021-2031\nCancer is identified as a priority for increased cross-border collaboration, particularly with the reinvigoration of the Ireland-Northern Ireland-US National Cancer Institute Memorandum of Understanding The National Cancer Strategy (2017-2026)identified an urgent need for frameworks that increase Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Reusable (FAIR) sharing of health data and stated it was a major obstacle to measuring performance and evidence-based policy decision. QUB PI Prof Lawler, Scientific Director of DATA-CAN the UK’s Health Data Research Hub for Cancer, together with the Northern Ireland Cancer Registry highlighted the lack of a connected IRE national health informatics system as a major obstacle to cross-border research on the impacts of COVID-19 on cancer [1]."

    "text": "Interoperability in Health Care Data\nThe Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership (OMOP) Common Data Model (CDM) enables the capture of information (e.g., encounters, patients, providers, diagnoses, drugs, measurements and procedures) in the same way across different institutions. This can assist organization overcome traditional challenges when comparing health data across systems. Traditionally healthcare organizations have stored a wealth of data, in a various formats for a myriad of different purposes without any coordination or standardization and healthcare system may use different names for a data field (such as systolic blood pressure or blood glucose level) making it difficult to compare data between systems. The purpose of a common data model (CDM) is to standardize the format and content of observational data so that standardized applications, tools and methods can be applied across different datasets. Use of a CDM integrates medical records across healthcare organizations so that these data resources can be queried to answer important questions quickly and efficiently.\nThe Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership (OMOP) is a public-private collaboration chaired by the US FDA, who proposed a common data model (CDM) [2] for storing and harmonizing heterogeneous health data. OMOP-CDM is maintained by OHDSI The European Medicines Agency (EMA) has recommended OMOP-CDM as a gold standard for harmonization of records; The European Health Data and Evidence Network (EHDEN) aims to harmonize >400 million diverse health records from 23 EU countries, using OMOP-CDM [3].\nAn advantage of OMOP-CDM is deployment of a federated model and GDPR compliance. Data remain locally and each local health data provider can control access to their data. Only aggregated results of queries are exported from each local site (Figure 1), preserving patient privacy/security.\nOHDSI and EHDEN projects are making healthcare data FAIR at an unprecedented scale, creating new research and economic opportunities in eHealth. To date, >810,000,000 patient records (approximately 11% of the global population) from 34 different countries have been mapped to OMOP-CDM, including records from All of Us, UK BioBank, eMERGE, the National COVID-19 Cohort Collaborative (N3C), and the national data network in Korea. Lead PI Culhane is a member of the OHDSI community, and has published high-impact publications with OHDSI [4–6], including the study of the safety profile of hydroxychloroquine in nearly 1 million patients, whose findings informed public health guidance from the EMA. Despite vast benefits to patients, design and monitoring of clinical trials, cross-border eHealth research, and the benefits of participation in international EU and Global research, there is a critical skill shortage in ehealth research on the island of Ireland. IRE is not a data partner in EHDEN and there are no IRE or NI SMEs that are certified by EHDEN."

Key areas of research include: the study of genetic changes driving the development of blood cancers and factors leading to relapse and resistant disease. In addition, Ruth has an interest in innovating diagnostic pathways for patients, applying novel tech and AI tools, to aid accurate and timely diagnosis of blood cancers and to improve patient acquisition to clinical trials.\nRuth received her medical degree from NUI Galway in 2002 and began her specialist haematology training in Ireland in 2006 later transferring to Oxford. She was awarded a Cancer Research UK Fellowship to undertake a PhD at the University of Oxford. Her doctoral research focused on the applications of Next Generation Sequencing Technologies in Leukaemia. A key finding of this work was the discovery of a novel gene mutation in SAMHD1 that predicts chemotherapy resistance in CLL. She has published with numerous UK and European CLL groups and continues to maintain active links in the haematology genomics research field.\nRuth is the translational co-chair of the Haematology and Lymphoma DSSG of Cancer Trials Ireland clinical trial network. She is an Investigator with the Blood Cancer Network Ireland and a member of the molecular advisory group for the National Cancer Control Programme that guides the development of a national infrastructure for partner diagnostics in Haemato-Oncology.\nWithin UL, Ruth is a pillar lead for the Basic Sciences Pillar of ULCan and a member of the Limerick DCRC Development Committee.
