    "section": "",
    "text": "The findings have just been published today in the European Journal of Cancer.\nThe study, from researchers of the All-Island e-Health Hub for Cancer, which is led by Queen’s University Belfast and University of Limerick, King’s College London, UK, Ghent University, Belgium, the International Brain Tumour Alliance and the European Cancer Organisation looked at published cancer research papers from the 28 EU Member States (plus Iceland, Norway, Switzerland and the United Kingdom (UK), from two specific years (2009 and 2019) and used these data to determine female cancer research participation and female cancer research leadership over that decade.\nIt found whilst there was a slight increase in overall female participation in cancer research between 2009 and 2019 (as judged by percentage of females as authors in cancer research papers, which rose from 42% to 49%), female research leadership tended to stall, only rising from a low of 24% to 34% in the study period.\nThe study also found that female cancer research leadership was highest in the majority of Eastern European countries and in Scandinavia, compared to countries in central Europe. However, when cancer researchers from central European countries worked abroad, the percentage of females became similar to that of their host countries.\nThe research suggests that female cancer research participation is heavily influenced by availability and relative cost of child-care, which is more favourable in Scandinavia and Eastern Europe than in central/western Europe. These countries are also generous in the provision of maternity and/or paternity leave for new parents.\nSpeaking about the work, Irish Minister for Further Education, Research, Innovation and Science Simon Harris T.D. said “This research is very timely and impactful. It highlights the importance of gender equality in cancer research. We recognise the need to address gender balance in science and do more to address this issue. I am committed to increasing female participation and leadership across the higher education sector, as such I was delighted to introduce the Senior Academic Leadership Initiative (SALI), which is allowing us to ensure that enhanced female senior academic leadership is delivered within higher education across Ireland. The research highlighted here, supported through the North South Research Programme, shows that Ireland is heading in the right direction, but emphasises that there is still work to be done to achieve gender equity.”\nSee more at the Irish News QUB News and UL News\n\nRelated articles on gender and cancer\nGinsburg O, Vanderpuye V, Beddoe AM, Bhoo-Pathy N, Bray F, Caduff C, Florez N, Fadhil I, Hammad N, Heidari S, Kataria I, Kumar S, Liebermann E, Moodley J, Mutebi M, Mukherji D, Nugent R, So WKW, Soto-Perez-de-Celis E, Unger-Saldaña K, Allman G, Bhimani J, Bourlon MT, Eala MAB, Hovmand PS, Kong YC, Menon S, Taylor CD, Soerjomataram I.

    "text": "Interoperability in Health Care Data\nThe Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership (OMOP) Common Data Model (CDM) enables the capture of information (e.g., encounters, patients, providers, diagnoses, drugs, measurements and procedures) in the same way across different institutions. This can assist organization overcome traditional challenges when comparing health data across systems. Traditionally healthcare organizations have stored a wealth of data, in a various formats for a myriad of different purposes without any coordination or standardization and healthcare system may use different names for a data field (such as systolic blood pressure or blood glucose level) making it difficult to compare data between systems. The purpose of a common data model (CDM) is to standardize the format and content of observational data so that standardized applications, tools and methods can be applied across different datasets. Use of a CDM integrates medical records across healthcare organizations so that these data resources can be queried to answer important questions quickly and efficiently.\nThe Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership (OMOP) is a public-private collaboration chaired by the US FDA, who proposed a common data model (CDM) [2] for storing and harmonizing heterogeneous health data. OMOP-CDM is maintained by OHDSI The European Medicines Agency (EMA) has recommended OMOP-CDM as a gold standard for harmonization of records; The European Health Data and Evidence Network (EHDEN) aims to harmonize &gt;400 million diverse health records from 23 EU countries, using OMOP-CDM [3].\nAn advantage of OMOP-CDM is deployment of a federated model and GDPR compliance. Data remain locally and each local health data provider can control access to their data. Only aggregated results of queries are exported from each local site (Figure 1), preserving patient privacy/security.\nOHDSI and EHDEN projects are making healthcare data FAIR at an unprecedented scale, creating new research and economic opportunities in eHealth. To date, &gt;810,000,000 patient records (approximately 11% of the global population) from 34 different countries have been mapped to OMOP-CDM, including records from All of Us, UK BioBank, eMERGE, the National COVID-19 Cohort Collaborative (N3C), and the national data network in Korea. Lead PI Culhane is a member of the OHDSI community, and has published high-impact publications with OHDSI [4–6], including the study of the safety profile of hydroxychloroquine in nearly 1 million patients, whose findings informed public health guidance from the EMA. Despite vast benefits to patients, design and monitoring of clinical trials, cross-border eHealth research, and the benefits of participation in international EU and Global research, there is a critical skill shortage in ehealth research on the island of Ireland. IRE is not a data partner in EHDEN and there are no IRE or NI SMEs that are certified by EHDEN.",

Johnston.\nThe Consortium is a unique partnership, established in 1999, between the governments of Ireland, Northern Ireland and the U.S., as a direct result of the Good Friday Agreement.\nThe study shows how the Consortium acted as a catalyst, enhancing cancer research quantity and quality both between researchers in Northern Ireland and Ireland and with premier institutions in the U.S., leading to improved cancer outcomes on the island of Ireland.\nThe study highlighted a 550% increase in the quality of joint cancer research on the island, an economic dividend which enhanced research leading to an increase in university spin-out activity and an improvement in cancer outcomes.\nCheck out these links to learn more!\nUL News and QUB News",

    "text": "Prof. Ruth Clifford is a Consultant Haematologist at UHL since November 2016. Her clinical practice is in malignant haematology, in particular, the care of patients with lymphoid malignancies including chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL). Key areas of research include: the study of genetic changes driving the development of blood cancers and factors leading to relapse and resistant disease. In addition, Ruth has an interest in innovating diagnostic pathways for patients, applying novel tech and AI tools, to aid accurate and timely diagnosis of blood cancers and to improve patient acquisition to clinical trials.\nRuth received her medical degree from NUI Galway in 2002 and began her specialist haematology training in Ireland in 2006 later transferring to Oxford. She was awarded a Cancer Research UK Fellowship to undertake a PhD at the University of Oxford. Her doctoral research focused on the applications of Next Generation Sequencing Technologies in Leukaemia. A key finding of this work was the discovery of a novel gene mutation in SAMHD1 that predicts chemotherapy resistance in CLL. She has published with numerous UK and European CLL groups and continues to maintain active links in the haematology genomics research field.\nRuth is the translational co-chair of the Haematology and Lymphoma DSSG of Cancer Trials Ireland clinical trial network. She is an Investigator with the Blood Cancer Network Ireland and a member of the molecular advisory group for the National Cancer Control Programme that guides the development of a national infrastructure for partner diagnostics in Haemato-Oncology.\nWithin UL, Ruth is a pillar lead for the Basic Sciences Pillar of ULCan and a member of the Limerick DCRC Development Committee. Ruth has a number of active collaborative research projects across the ULCan pillars and is keen to progress links between ULHG and UL on cutting edge cancer research for the benefit of the Mid West and the broader cancer community.",
